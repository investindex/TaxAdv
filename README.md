# Tax-advantaged accounts

In a taxable account, there are tax implications every time you receive a distribution or realize a gain or loss. We'll cover tax-advantaged accounts with various properties, but they all share 

### Retirement accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) account. They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. In this context, "earnings" or "investment earnings" refer to the growth in value of investments in these accounts. "Distributions" are jargon for withdrawals from the account, and "qualified distributions" are withdrawals that are penalty-free because they comply with the purposes of the account. There are two types of retirement account plans that reduce taxes in different ways, and an individual can use one or both. With a [traditional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp) plan, your contributions are tax-deductible in that year and investments in the account grow without taxation. While no income tax is paid on contributions or investment earnings, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a [Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp) plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings in the account and [qualified distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free. Traditional accounts are tax-deferred, and Roth accounts are tax-exempt. The distinctions introduced so far provide four subdivisions: traditional IRA, Roth IRA, traditional 401(k), and Roth 401(k).

Distributions are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% tax penalty on top of triggering any tax owed. You're exempt from penalty if you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) or you're withdrawing only contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth IRA. Once you turn 59½, you can withdraw any amount penalty-free (additionally, Roth IRAs must have been open for at least five years). If you expect your income to rise over time, it makes sense to contribute to Roth accounts earlier in life and traditional accounts later in life. I explore when to contribute to Roth and traditional accounts [in the section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional). You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% [matching policy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp), you will earn a risk-free, tax-advantaged 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

There are two exceptions. The first is if you're drowning in debt, barely able to make interest payments. If you're anywhere close to this situation, you shouldn't be contributing to retirement accounts. The other exception is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not fully vest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentivize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. If you left while you were 40% vested, the employer would be able to claw back 60% of their contributions. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are assured regardless of when you leave the company. The [403(b)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp) account is a close relative to the 401(k) account; one major difference is that employer contributions often vest immediately. Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can continue tax-deductible contributions up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp). These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age.

The IRS offers a major tax credit to those with low income who contribute to retirement accounts. Read about the saver's credit [here](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#savers-credit).

TERMINOLOGY WARNING: Many people simply say "401(k)" with the implication of a traditional plan. Most 401(k) accounts _are_ traditional, which means they are tax-deferred accounts. But many employers also offer a Roth 401(k), so it can be important to specify whether you're referring to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). One more gripe: please don't capitalize every letter of "Roth". It's not an acronym, it's named after [a US senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roth).

### Health savings accounts

Properly used, HSAs have the most tax advantages of any account. Contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualifying medical expenses are tax-free! The account can pay for your own medical expenses as well as those of your spouse, dependents, and [certain](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178869) non-dependent children. You can pay for medical expenses directly from the account, or you can wait and reimburse yourself later. The delay can be two days or 20 years, as long as you can document the payments and your HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Documentation is not typically needed for HSA reimbursement, so it may never be used, but the IRS can request it if your tax returns are audited.

Unlike contributions to your IRA or 401(k), contributions to your HSA even [escape](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For [most people](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-essentials), FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of earned income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to income tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k). Even in this situation, the HSA is superior because the contributions avoid FICA taxes on the front end, but contributions to an IRA or 401(k) do not.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> An HSA is a stealth retirement account that beats retirement accounts at their own job.

You shouldn’t feel the need to choose between a dichotomy of investing or not investing in your HSA. If it suits you, you can spend some of your HSA funds on medical expenses throughout your life while investing a portion for old age. If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 from your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend [far more](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2013/research-health-care-birth-death/) on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed. A small added bonus is that you benefit from credit card rewards by not paying with your HSA debit card; you can do this even if you don't invest in your HSA, and immediately withdraw the amount from your HSA after paying with your credit card.

HSAs can pay for a variety of health care expenses that may be surprising — not just co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles. Eligible expenses [include](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178887) eyeglasses and contact lenses, braces, certain OTC medications like aspirin and ibuprofen, childbirth classes, therapy and psychiatric care, guide dog expenses, changes you make to your home for medical reasons, sunscreen, tampons and pads, hearing aids, and out-of-pocket transportation expenses needed to travel to medical care. Certain items are conditionally eligible, such as wigs _if_ your disease or treatment has caused hair loss. A letter of medical necessity from your doctor can greatly broaden the universe of eligible items.

Before 65 you cannot pay for insurance premiums with your HSA unless you're receiving unemployment benefits or using [COBRA](https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/), the federal program that allows you to keep your health insurance with a group plan after leaving a job by paying the full cost yourself. Once you turn 65, or enroll in Social Security or Medicare, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. But you can pay for most Medicare premiums with your HSA, as well as [long-term care insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua7WMUSV1-A) premiums. If the investment approach were initiated early in life and maximized, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds by reimbursing yourself for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. This is worth underlining as one of the best features of your HSA: with ongoing medical expenses that build over time and have not been reimbursed, you have the freedom to withdraw and [reimburse yourself](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) for those expenses at any time, penalty- and tax-free. Meanwhile, that money stays in your HSA and enjoys tax-free investment. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

Not every American can contribute to an HSA every year. You're eligible to contribute only if you have a [high-deductible health plan (HDHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan). If you contribute to your HSA while you have an HDHP, then switch to a non-HDHP, you can still use your HSA to spend and invest. You can resume contributions if you switch back to an HDHP. It's beyond the scope of this guide to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different plans for different people. I will simply say that people with a wide variety of medical expenses can find an HDHP to be suitable. The unique tax benefits of an HSA, even if not used for investing, make HDHPs a good fit for more people than they would be otherwise. Unfortunately, not all employers offer an HDHP. While it's always possible to pay for an individual insurance plan, group plans are less expensive, so it's likely that HSA contributions will not be feasible while working at such companies. You may want to take this into account when considering job offers, because it has real financial consequences. And if you're a taxpayer in [California or New Jersey](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#hsas), it's important to be aware of the tax treatment of HSAs in those states.

### 529 accounts

[529 accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp) are used to pay for the educational expenses of a specific beneficiary, although the beneficiary can be changed. Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. [US Treasury savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds) are [exempt from tax](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-savings-bonds-to-help-pay-for-college-2085509) if rolled into a 529 account within 60 days of redemption. You need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. This is partly why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you leave an employer is a good idea. You can also roll over while employed if your 401(k) provider allows in-service rollovers (but many do not). You should consider carrying out a rollover at the first opportunity, because 401(k) providers [charge fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) that will hamper your investment growth.

&nbsp;

### Contribution limits

These drawbacks of 401(k) investing imply that once you've maxed out 401(k) employer matching, you should prioritize your IRA and potentially your HSA. Only if you have reached the limit of tax-deductible contributions to these accounts, and you want to contribute even more, should you return to your 401(k). Contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are far higher than those for IRAs, which is a major benefit for people with high income. In 2022, IRA contributions are limited to $6,000 (or $7,000 for those who are at least 50), whereas the 401(k) limit is $20,500 (or $27,000 for those who are at least 50). The 401(k) limit is only for employee contributions; the limit for the sum of employee and employer contributions is a whopping $61,000 (or $67,500 for those who are at least 50). HSA limits are $3,650 for single plans and $7,300 for family plans, with an additional $1,000 for those who are at least 55. If your employer contributes to your HSA, you're still limited 

Contributions to your 401(k), IRA, or HSA do not affect contribution limits in either of the other two types of accounts. You can contribute to both Roth and traditional accounts in the same year if you wish, but they have a joint limit. A 30-year-old who contributed $3K to their traditional IRA in 2022 has a remaining limit of $3K in their Roth IRA (and the 401(k) limit would be unaffected). IRA contributions are also limited by earned income. If someone earned a pre-tax total of $4K from their job in a given year, they could contribute no more than $4K (regardless of whether they realized capital gains, which are not earned income). Further limits are described [here](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-advantaged-accounts).

&nbsp;

### HSA rebels

Despite all the features I’ve celebrated about HSAs, there is some potentially [bad news](https://impersonalfinances.com/california-and-new-jersey-tax-hsas/). HSA contributions are tax-deductible with regard to federal income tax, FICA taxes, and state taxes in most _but not all_ states. There are two holdouts: California and New Jersey. In these two states, HSA contributions and earnings receive no state tax breaks. Despite the federal government designating HSAs as tax-advantaged accounts nearly 20 years ago, CA and NJ do not agree and will tax you like you’re investing in a taxable account. If you plan to live in either of these states for a long time, the arguments I’ve made about HSA investing are far weaker. Separately, New Hampshire has a mild tax which doesn't amount to a major drawback of HSAs in that state. NH [taxes](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/faq/interest-dividend.htm#who) interest and dividends that exceed $2,400 for single filers and $4,800 for joint filers. Surprisingly, interest and dividends in your HSA are included. However, since NH doesn't tax capital gains, the effect of this tax on your returns will be negligible unless you have a very large portfolio. For people with taxable portfolios smaller than $200K, this is likely to trigger zero tax. Tennessee had a similar tax until [recently](https://www.beacontn.org/hall-tax-finally-gone-forever). Feel free to write to representatives in these three states, especially CA and NJ, encouraging them to repent.

&nbsp;

### Required minimum distributions (RMDs)

Traditional IRAs and similar accounts have [required minimum distributions (RMDs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp). The government wants you to pay income tax on that tax-deferred money eventually, so in your old age they compel you to withdraw a fraction of the IRA's value that depends on your age and population-level expected lifespan. The age at which RMDs begin was 70½ until 2020, but it is now 72 and a bill [currently in Congress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-tax-playbook-for-draining-your-401-k-in-retirement-11649079814) would gradually raise it to 75 by 2033. RMDs up to $100K can be donated to charity in a tax-deductible manner if you have no need for them and want to avoid the income taxes that they would otherwise trigger. Roth IRAs do _not_ have RMDs, because taxes on that money were fully paid when you contributed to the account. Oddly, Roth 401(k) accounts do have RMDs even though no tax is owed, but these can be avoided by rolling over the account to a Roth IRA.

&nbsp;

### Charity

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. Your HSA is [poorly suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) to charity as well as inheritance, so it's best used for personal spending after 65 if the amount exceeds anticipated health care spending. Your spouse can inherit your HSA with no tax paid — the funds are absorbed into their HSA — but any other personal beneficiary would have to pay tax on the full amount in the year of your death. If you donate to charity while you're alive using HSA funds, you still have to pay tax on those withdrawals. However, if the beneficiary of your HSA is a charity, there is no tax due when they receive the funds upon your death. Both traditional and Roth IRAs are better-suited to leave to children or other persons. None of these concerns should be a dominant influence on how much money you choose to spend or donate, but considering them will increase your wealth and the wealth of your beneficiaries.

&nbsp;

### Later section

There is additional, highly important information on tax-advantaged accounts in the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-advantaged-accounts). It's deferred because the tax essentials introduced [first](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) are a prerequisite to that info. Immediately below that is a discussion of how to think about contributing to [Roth or traditional](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional) accounts.

## Summary

<!--
For various examples of how judicious use of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts during working and retirement years can enhance the longevity of your portfolio, see chapter 10 of Larry Swedroe's [book on retirement](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def).

Contributions to a traditional account are tax-deductible, but you pay income tax when you withdraw. Contributions to a Roth account are _not_ tax-deductible, but you pay no tax when you withdraw. Consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

The benefits of HSAs are:
* Tax-deductible contributions, tax-free investment, and tax-free qualified distributions.
* HSA contributions through payroll deduction avoid income taxes _and_ FICA taxes (as well as state payroll taxes, if any). Contributions to traditional IRAs and employee contributions to traditional 401(k) accounts avoid only income tax. See [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#f1) on employer contributions to 401(k) accounts.
* The ability to spend on health care from your checking account (while getting credit card rewards if you use a credit card), and reimburse yourself from the HSA in the future. With enough reimbursible expenses incurred over time, your HSA becomes a tax-free investment account that you can [withdraw from if needed](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) at any time, penalty- and tax-free.
* The ability to withdraw penalty-free for non-medical reasons after age 65 (like a traditional IRA), but having still avoided FICA taxes on the front end. Investing in an HSA is strictly better than doing so in a traditional IRA unless (a) you withdraw the money prematurely, (b) you want to donate the money before death, (c) you plan to leave the money to a non-spousal person upon death, or (d) you're a [CA or NJ](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#hsa-rebels) taxpayer.
* Qualified distributions include health care expenses for your spouse and dependents. During old age, qualified distributions include paying for long-term care insurance premiums and most Medicare premiums.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> The only exception is _employer_ contributions to a 401(k) account (or another employer-sponsored retirement account). Employee contributions are subject to FICA taxes. Even if your employer offers a Roth 401(k), employers do not contribute to your Roth 401(k). Employer contributions are made to your traditional account regardless of which plan you contribute to. However, if [a certain bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/house-passes-secure-act-2point0-heres-what-it-means-for-your-retirement-.html) currently in Congress is passed, employers could be given the option of contributing to their employees' Roth 401(k) accounts.

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit use of borrowed funds. [↩](#fn2)

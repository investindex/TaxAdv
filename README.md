# Tax-advantaged accounts

In a taxable brokerage account, every time you receive a distribution or realize a gain or loss, there is a [taxable event](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableevent.asp) — an event that affects your tax reporting and usually your tax liability. We'll cover various kinds of tax-advantaged accounts, but they all share one feature: your trades in the account are sheltered from tax. On top of other benefits, capital gains and distributions are never taxed while the money is in the account, and you can adjust investments as often as you want with no concern for tax implications. As [an example](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-efficient-investing) in a later section illustrates, this is a massive advantage over a taxable account.

In this context, "earnings" or "investment earnings" refer to the growth in value of investments in these accounts. Withdrawals from the account are called "distributions", and "qualified distributions" are withdrawals that are penalty-free because they comply with the purposes of the account.

### Retirement accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) account. They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. There are two types of retirement account plans that reduce taxes in different ways, and an individual can use one or both. With a [traditional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp) plan, your contributions are tax-deductible in that year and investments in the account grow without taxation. While no income tax is paid on contributions or investment earnings, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a [Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp) plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings in the account and [qualified distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) (i.e., withdrawals) are tax-free. Traditional accounts are tax-deferred, and Roth accounts are tax-exempt. The distinctions introduced so far provide four subdivisions: traditional IRA, Roth IRA, traditional 401(k), and Roth 401(k).

Distributions are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% tax penalty on top of triggering any tax owed. You're exempt from penalty if you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) or you're withdrawing only contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth IRA. Once you turn 59½, you can withdraw any amount penalty-free (additionally, Roth IRAs must have been open for at least five years). If you expect your income to rise over time, it makes sense to contribute to Roth accounts earlier in life and traditional accounts later in life. I explore when to contribute to Roth and traditional accounts [in the section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional).

Most employers contribute to your employer-sponsored account, according to a [matching policy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp) they dictate. Because matching policies vary greatly, you should inquire about a potential employer's policy when considering a job. It's part of your compensation. If there is a 50% matching policy up to 6% of your income, you will earn a risk-free, tax-advantaged 50% return simply by contributing up to 6% of your gross income. You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your 401(k). Even if you later needed to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

There are two exceptions. The first is if you're drowning in debt, barely able to make interest payments. If you're anywhere close to this situation, you shouldn't be contributing to retirement accounts. Someone with manageable debt should contribute if they have a high matching rate. An account with 50% matching is one of the few places to invest your money more effectively than paying off high-interest debt. But if you have debt due to issues with responsible spending, addressing that should be the priority. The other exception is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not fully vest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentivize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. If you left while you were 40% vested, the employer would be able to claw back 60% of their contributions. They also claw back the earnings on those contributions, but this is fair because it applies even if earnings have been negative, in which case they claw back less money than they contributed. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are assured regardless of when you leave the company.

Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can continue your own contributions up to a legal limit. Not all employer contributions are matching contributions. Some employers make fixed contributions regardless of employee contributions. The [403(b)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp) account is a close relative to the 401(k) account; one major difference is that employer contributions often vest immediately. 403(b) plans are for nonprofits like public schools, universities, and hospitals. I'll often say "401(k)" as shorthand for all work retirement accounts, including 401(k) and 403(b) accounts. Work retirement accounts use an [automatic investment plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticinvestmentplan.asp), in which an employee decides on an amount or percentage to be deducted from each paycheck. This deduction is automatically contributed to the account and invested in the employee's chosen allocation. This tends to promote good investing behavior, because it doesn't let you hesitate to invest and stay out of the market, and it requires no attention unless you decide to change your allocation.

If the fees in your retirement plan are too high — which is a [common problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20220616141116/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/your-money/403-b-retirement-plan-tips.html) — then it is quite possible to lobby for changes to the plan. You might be able to do this yourself at a very small business, or in collaboration with others at a large institution.

The IRS offers a major tax credit to those with low income who contribute to retirement accounts. Read about the saver's credit [here](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#savers-credit).

TERMINOLOGY WARNING: Many people simply say "401(k)" with the implication of a traditional plan. Most 401(k) accounts _are_ traditional, which means they are tax-deferred accounts. But many employers also offer a Roth 401(k), so it can be important to specify whether you're referring to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). One more gripe: please don't capitalize every letter of "Roth". It's not an acronym, it's named after [a US senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roth).

&nbsp;

### Health savings account (HSA)

Properly used, an HSA has the most tax advantages of any account. Contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualifying medical expenses are tax-free! The account can pay for your own medical expenses as well as those of your spouse, dependents, and [certain](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178869) non-dependent children. You can pay for medical expenses directly from the account, or you can wait and reimburse yourself later. The delay can be two days or 20 years, as long as you can document the payments and your HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Documentation is not typically needed for HSA reimbursement — you can just reimburse yourself whenever you want. So it may never be used, but the IRS can request it if your tax returns are audited.

Unlike contributions to your IRA or 401(k), contributions to your HSA even [escape](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes — the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare — as long as you contribute through your employer’s [payroll deduction](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/payroll-deductions-1918223). For [most people](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-essentials), FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of earned income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to income tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k). Even in this situation, the HSA is superior because the contributions avoid FICA taxes on the front end, but contributions to an IRA or 401(k) do not.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> An HSA is a stealth retirement account that beats retirement accounts at their own job.

You shouldn’t feel the need to choose between a dichotomy of investing or not investing in your HSA. If it suits you, you can spend some of your HSA funds on medical expenses throughout your life while investing a portion for old age. If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 from your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend far more on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](http://fidelityinvestments2020news.q4web.com/press-releases/news-details/2022/Fidelity-Releases-2022-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-65-Year-Old-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-an-Average-of-315000-for-Medical-Expenses/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed. A small added bonus is that you benefit from credit card rewards by not paying with your HSA debit card; you can do this even if you don't invest in your HSA, and immediately withdraw the amount from your HSA after paying with your credit card.

#### Uses of an HSA

HSAs can pay for a variety of health care expenses that may be surprising — not just co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles. Eligible expenses [include](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178887) eyeglasses and contact lenses, braces, certain OTC medications like aspirin and ibuprofen, childbirth classes, therapy and psychiatric care, guide dog expenses, changes you make to your home for medical reasons, sunscreen, tampons and pads, alcoholism treatment, hearing aids, and out-of-pocket transportation expenses needed to travel to medical care. Certain items are conditionally eligible, such as wigs _if_ your disease or treatment has caused hair loss. A letter of medical necessity from your doctor can greatly broaden the universe of eligible items.

Before 65 you cannot pay for insurance premiums with your HSA unless you're receiving unemployment benefits or using [COBRA](https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/), the federal program that allows you to keep your health insurance with a group plan after leaving a job by paying the full cost yourself. Once you turn 65, or enroll in Social Security or Medicare, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. But you can pay for most Medicare premiums with your HSA, as well as [long-term care insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua7WMUSV1-A) premiums. If the investment approach were initiated early in life and maximized, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds by reimbursing yourself for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. This is worth underlining as one of the best features of your HSA: with ongoing medical expenses that build over time and have not been reimbursed, you have the freedom to withdraw and [reimburse yourself](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) for those expenses at any time, penalty- and tax-free. Meanwhile, that money stays in your HSA and enjoys tax-free investment. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

#### Eligibility

Not every American can contribute to an HSA every year. You're eligible to contribute only if you have a [high-deductible health plan (HDHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan). If you contribute to your HSA while you have an HDHP, then switch to a non-HDHP, you can still use your HSA to spend and invest. You can resume contributions if you switch back to an HDHP. It's beyond the scope of this guide to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different plans for different people. I will simply say that people with a wide variety of medical expenses can find an HDHP to be suitable. HDHPs have lower premiums but higher deductibles. The unique tax benefits of an HSA, even if not used for investing, make HDHPs a good fit for more people than they would be otherwise. And some employers contribute to their employees' HSAs. [A majority](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-deductible-health-plan-study) of private employees now use HDHPs. Unfortunately, not all employers offer an HDHP. While it's always possible to pay for an individual insurance plan, group plans are less expensive, so it's likely that HSA contributions will not be feasible while working at such companies. You may want to take this into account when considering job offers, because it has real financial consequences. And if you're a taxpayer in [California or New Jersey](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#hsa-rebels), it's important to be aware of the tax treatment of HSAs in those states.

In order for a plan to [count](https://www.healthcare.gov/high-deductible-health-plan/hdhp-hsa-information/) as an HDHP and thus be HSA-eligible, it must have a deductible of at least $1,400/$2,800 (single/family), and an out-of-pocket maximum of no more than $7,050/$14,100. These figures are for 2022 and are adjusted for inflation each year. Some plans with high deductibles are not HSA-eligible because their out-of-pocket maximums are too high. So despite its name, an HDHP is not simply a plan with a high deductible. If you decide to contribute to an HSA independently because your employer doesn't offer deposits through payroll deduction, be very careful to ensure that your plan [is an HDHP](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-hdhp-is-hsa-qualified). In addition to the two plan-specific requirements, you must have no other health coverage and must not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. Some employers don't offer contributions to an HSA through payroll deduction. Not contributing through payroll deduction means you won't benefit from the reduction in payroll taxes, but even without this, HSA contributions are often still worthwhile. Self-employed people may also find themselves in this situation.

See the [summary](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#summary) for a concise recap of the benefits of an HSA.

&nbsp;

### Contribution limits

Contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are far higher than those for IRAs, which is a major benefit for people with high income. In 2022, IRA contributions are limited to $6,000 (or $7,000 for those who are at least 50), whereas the 401(k) limit is $20,500 (or $27,000 for those who are at least 50). The 401(k) limit is only for employee contributions; the limit for the sum of employee and employer contributions is a whopping $61,000 (or $67,500 for those who are at least 50). HSA limits are $3,650 for single plans and $7,300 for family plans, with an additional $1,000 for those who are at least 55. If your employer contributes to your HSA, the total allowed contribution is the same. The increased contribution limits for people over an age threshold enable "catch-up contributions". Note that the age thresholds are different for retirement accounts (50) and an HSA (55). The date on which you were born doesn't matter: anyone born in 1972 can start making catch-up contributions to their work retirement account in 2022, because they turn 50 in that year.

Contributions to your 401(k), IRA, or HSA do not affect contribution limits in either of the other two types of accounts. You can contribute to Roth and traditional IRAs in the same year if you wish, but the joint contribution limit is no larger than if you contribute to only one (and the same for work retirement accounts). IRA contributions are also limited by gross earned income. If someone earned a pre-tax total of $4K from their job in a given year, they could contribute no more than $4K to an IRA (regardless of whether they realized capital gains or received cash dividends, neither of which counts as earned income). 401(k) contributions are inherently limited by earned income, because they're made through payroll deduction.

If you don't have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) for the entire year, you may not be eligible to contribute the maximum to an HSA. Let's say you change jobs in June and change your health insurance on June 15 from an HDHP (at your old job) to a non-HDHP (at your new job). HSA eligibility is determined on the first of each month, so you would be eligible for HSA contributions in January through June, the first six months of the year. This would reduce your maximum to 6/12 of whatever maximum would otherwise apply to you. You can still contribute to your HSA at any time — not just in January through June — but your maximum for that year would be cut in half.

This simple _pro rata_ calculation is often how you determine whether your maximum contribution is reduced. But there is a [last month rule](https://www.hsaedge.com/2017/10/20/how-to-determine-if-you-used-the-hsa-last-month-rule/): if you're covered by an HDHP on December 1, you're eligible to contribute the maximum regardless of when that coverage began. So if you switched from a non-HDHP to an HDHP on October 1, you would be eligible to contribute the full maximum, not just the _pro rata_ 3/12 of the maximum. However, this carries a condition. In order for those contributions to be compliant, you must _remain_ eligible for an HSA for 12 months (the "testing period"). So if you switched to an HDHP on October 1 and took advantage of the last month rule by maxing out your HSA, you would need to stay with an HDHP until the following October 1. If you didn't, you would need to withdraw the overcontribution, and you would owe income taxes as well as a 10% tax penalty. The last month rule applies in the [same way](https://www.hsaedge.com/2014/03/25/hsa-last-month-rule-and-testing-period-explained/) when switching between single coverage and family coverage.

### Rollovers

A [rollover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) is a transfer of money (or assets) between two tax-advantaged accounts. The most common rollovers are between an IRA and an employer-sponsored retirement account like a 401(k) account, or between two IRAs.

When you leave an employer, it's generally better to roll over the money in your employer plan to an IRA than to remain in your old employer's plan or roll it over to your new employer's plan. An IRA gives you much broader options for investments, has no account-based fees, and lets you choose your custodian (usually a brokerage firm like Fidelity). There are a few potential benefits to choosing your employer's plan instead: it may have better [creditor protection](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040716/which-retirement-funds-are-protected-creditors.asp) than an IRA (depending on your state) in the event of bankruptcy; it permits you to take out ["loans"](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/borrow-from-401k-loan.asp) from the account; and, in rare cases, it may grant you easier access to investments that wouldn't be available in an IRA (but usually the investment options are worse). For nearly everyone, the benefits of an IRA greatly outweigh the potential benefits of an employer-sponsored account.

When performing a rollover from an employer plan to an IRA, you'll generally want to avoid tax implications. To avoid a taxable event, you can roll over a traditional 401(k) account to a traditional IRA, or a Roth 401(k) account to a Roth IRA. You can also open a rollover IRA, which is identical to a traditional IRA except that it facilitates a rollover into a new employer's plan. The paragraph above described why this is not ideal for most people. If you plan to keep the money in your own IRA, you can roll it over to a traditional IRA instead. Your traditional IRA may already have money in it if you've made prior contributions. Rolling money into an IRA has no effect on the account's contribution limit.

Money can be rolled over by performing a "direct rollover" or an "indirect rollover". A direct rollover is far simpler and carries very little potential for error. The entire process is the following. If you don't already have an IRA with the appropriate plan — traditional or Roth — open an IRA with the broker that you'd like as your new IRA custodian, such as Charles Schwab or Fidelity. Ask their customer service what info you'll need to transfer the money. Call the current custodian of your employer plan, and tell them you'd like to perform a direct rollover to an IRA. Your current custodian will transfer the money directly to the new custodian. In contrast, when you perform an indirect rollover, you receive the money yourself and must deposit it in the new account within 60 days to avoid tax implications. Unfortunately, 20% of the amount is withheld in case federal taxes are triggered, and you have to make up the 20% out of your own savings until your federal refund arrives (or face taxes and potential penalties). On top of this, you can perform only one indirect rollover in any rolling 12-month period. The complexity and potential for error is why I don't recommend indirect rollovers. 

You can also transfer money between IRAs if you'd like to change custodians or consolidate your accounts. The process is very similar. This would involve transferring between two traditional IRAs or two Roth IRAs. Transferring money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is a distinct process, because it's a taxable event. When you perform a [Roth conversion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iraconversion.asp), the amount transferred from a traditional account to a Roth account is added to your taxable income. The appropriate circumstances for a Roth conversion are discussed in the "[Roth or traditional?](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional)" section. It is [not possible](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) to transfer money from a Roth account to a traditional account.

We'll cover the motivations for transferring money between HSAs in a [later section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#hsa-investing).

### 529 account

A [529 account](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/what-is-a-529-plan) is for the educational expenses of a specific beneficiary. Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but a majority of states provide deductions under certain conditions. Investments grow tax-free and qualified distributions used for education are not taxed. [US Treasury savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds) are [exempt from tax](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-savings-bonds-to-help-pay-for-college-2085509) if rolled into a 529 account within 60 days of redemption. There are no annual contribution limits, but each state places its own limit on the sum of all contributions. You need to research the investment options available to you before opening an account. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account, but the options for your 401(k) or 529 account may be far less attractive. An adult acts as the custodian of a 529 account, but the beneficiary can assume control after reaching age 18. The account can not only pay for direct educational costs like tuition and books, but also indirect costs like off-campus housing and computers. If distributions are not used for qualified educational expenses (and don't meet conditions for an exception), investment earnings are subject to income taxes and a 10% federal tax penalty. If there is leftover money, one way to avoid paying these taxes is to change the beneficiary.

&nbsp;

### HSA rebels

Despite all the features I’ve celebrated about HSAs, there is some potentially [bad news](https://impersonalfinances.com/california-and-new-jersey-tax-hsas/). HSA contributions are tax-deductible with regard to federal income tax, FICA taxes, and state taxes in most _but not all_ states. There are two holdouts: California and New Jersey. In these two states, HSA contributions and earnings receive no state tax breaks. Despite the federal government designating HSAs as tax-advantaged accounts nearly 20 years ago, CA and NJ do not agree and will tax you like you’re investing in a taxable account. If you plan to live in either of these states for a long time, the arguments I’ve made about HSA investing are far weaker. Separately, New Hampshire has a mild tax which doesn't amount to a major drawback of HSAs in that state. NH [taxes](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/faq/interest-dividend.htm#who) interest and dividends that exceed $2,400 for single filers and $4,800 for joint filers. Surprisingly, interest and dividends in your HSA are included. However, since NH doesn't tax capital gains, the effect of this tax on your returns will be negligible unless you have a very large portfolio. For people with taxable portfolios smaller than $200K, this is likely to trigger zero tax. Tennessee had a similar tax until [recently](https://www.beacontn.org/hall-tax-finally-gone-forever). Feel free to write to representatives in these three states, especially CA and NJ, encouraging them to repent.

If you invest in your HSA and move to CA or NJ, you could buy US Treasury bonds to avoid state tax. US Treasury bonds are taxed only at the federal level. Since your HSA is federally tax-advantaged, US Treasury bond funds in your HSA would not be subject to any tax.<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>

### Required minimum distributions (RMDs)

Traditional IRAs and other tax-deferred retirement accounts have [required minimum distributions (RMDs)](https://www.thebalance.com/required-minimum-distributions-2388780). The government wants you to pay income tax on that tax-deferred money eventually, so in your old age they compel you to withdraw a fraction of the IRA's value that depends on your age and population-level expected lifespan. The age at which RMDs begin was 70½ until 2020, but it is now 72 and a bill [currently in Congress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-tax-playbook-for-draining-your-401-k-in-retirement-11649079814) would gradually raise it to 75 by 2033. Based on IRS tables that give a "distribution factor" for each age, you divide the value of your traditional IRA on Dec 31 of the previous year by the distribution factor to give the dollar amount of the RMD. The distribution factor decreases with higher age, so the fraction you must withdraw increases every year (until the factor stops changing after age 120). For this purpose, your age in a given year is your age on the last day of the year.

The deadline for the first RMD is Apr 1 in the year _after_ you turn 72. For the RMDs in all subsequent years, it is Dec 31. Everyone born in 1950 turns 72 in 2022, so they need to take their first RMD by Apr 1 2023, based on the account value on Dec 31 2021 and the distribution factor for age 72. Their second RMD due by Dec 31 2023 will be based on the account value on Dec 31 2022 and the distribution factor for age 73, and so on. Many institutions calculate your RMD for you and may even offer to automate the withdrawals.

RMDs up to $100K can be donated to charity in a tax-deductible manner if you already want to donate the amount, and would like to avoid the income taxes that they would otherwise trigger. Roth IRAs do _not_ have RMDs, because taxes on that money were fully paid when you contributed to the account. Oddly, Roth 401(k) accounts do have RMDs even though no tax is owed, but these can be avoided by rolling over the account to a Roth IRA. If you've reached age 72 and you're still working, you don't need to take RMDs from your employer's retirement plan until Apr 1 of the year after you retire.

HSAs have another subtle advantage over traditional IRAs: they don't have RMDs. But most retired people don't regard RMDs as an unnecessary tax burden. They need to withdraw money anyway! So withdrawing at least the amount dictated by the RMD is uncomplicated for the average person who's living off Social Security, their modest IRA, and perhaps a pension.

&nbsp;

### Charity

If charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. Your HSA is [poorly suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) to charity as well as inheritance, so it's best used for personal spending after 65 if the amount exceeds anticipated health care spending. Your spouse can inherit your HSA with no tax paid — the funds are absorbed into their HSA — but any other personal beneficiary would have to pay tax on the full amount in the year of your death. If you donate to charity while you're alive using HSA funds, you still have to pay tax on those withdrawals. However, if the beneficiary of your HSA is a charity, there is no tax due when they receive the funds upon your death. Both traditional and Roth IRAs are [better-suited](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#inheritance) to leave to children or other persons. None of these concerns should be a dominant influence on how much money you choose to spend or donate, but considering them will increase your wealth and the wealth of your beneficiaries.

### Later sections

In the [section on fund selection](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#working-with-limited-options-in-your-employers-retirement-plan), we discuss how to navigate restrictive and fee-laden employer retirement plans.

There is essential information on tax-advantaged accounts in the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-advantaged-accounts). It's deferred because the tax essentials introduced [first](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) in that section are a prerequisite. Immediately below that is a discussion of how to think about contributing to [Roth or traditional](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional) accounts. Another subsection on [tax-efficient investing](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-efficient-investing) emphasizes how much it helps your returns to invest in tax-advantaged accounts, and how important it is to contribute as much as possible as early in life as possible.

## Summary

<!--
For various examples of how judicious use of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts during working and retirement years can enhance the longevity of your portfolio, see chapter 10 of Larry Swedroe's [book on retirement](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def).

Contributions to a traditional account are tax-deductible, but you pay income tax when you withdraw. Contributions to a Roth account are _not_ tax-deductible, but you pay no tax when you withdraw. Consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

The benefits of HSAs are:
* Tax-deductible contributions, tax-free investment, and tax-free qualified distributions.
* The ability to spend on health care from your checking account (while getting credit card rewards if you use a credit card), and reimburse yourself from the HSA in the future. With enough reimbursible expenses incurred over time, your HSA becomes a tax-free investment account that you can [withdraw from if needed](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) at any time, penalty- and tax-free.
* HSA contributions through payroll deduction avoid income taxes _and_ FICA taxes (as well as state payroll taxes, if any). Contributions to traditional IRAs and employee contributions to traditional 401(k) accounts avoid only income tax. See [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#f2) on employer contributions to 401(k) accounts.
* The ability to withdraw penalty-free for non-medical reasons after age 65 (like a traditional IRA), but having still avoided FICA taxes on the front end and with no RMDs. Investing in an HSA is strictly better than doing so in a traditional IRA unless (a) you withdraw the money prematurely, (b) you want to donate the money before death, (c) you plan to leave the money to a non-spousal person upon death, or (d) you're a [CA or NJ](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv#hsa-rebels) taxpayer.
* Qualified distributions include medical expenses for your spouse and dependents. During old age, qualified distributions include paying for long-term care insurance premiums and most Medicare premiums.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> Employers owe payroll taxes, and while invisible to the employee, this is an additional cost of employing each person. Employers pay the same federal payroll taxes: 6.2% Social Security tax and 1.45% Medicare tax (so FICA taxes are actually 15.3% in total, not 7.65%). Contributing to your HSA means that both you _and_ your employer avoid paying FICA taxes on that amount. Employers also pay state unemployment taxes (SUTA) and federal unemployment taxes (FUTA), which fund unemployment benefits. There are only a few states in which employees also contribute to state unemployment benefits. Employers may owe local taxes as well. [↩](#fn1)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> The only contributions to a 401(k) account (or another employer-sponsored retirement account) that avoid FICA taxes are _employer_ contributions. Employee contributions are subject to FICA taxes. Even if your employer offers a Roth 401(k), employers do not contribute to your Roth 401(k). Employer contributions are made to your traditional account regardless of which plan you contribute to. However, if [a certain bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/house-passes-secure-act-2point0-heres-what-it-means-for-your-retirement-.html) currently in Congress is passed, employers could be given the option of contributing to their employees' Roth 401(k) accounts. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> There are a couple other investments that would avoid state tax. One is municipal bonds issued by your state. Income from muni bonds is tax-free at the federal level, and tax-free at the state level if the bond is issued by your home state (or by any US territory). You could invest in a fund like [CMB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239731/ishares-california-amtfree-muni-bond-etf) in California or [FNJHX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316089200) in New Jersey, or you could buy the bonds directly since expense ratios are higher than for typical bond funds. But I would argue that US Treasury bonds are preferable because they have minimal credit risk, you can invest in them with very low-cost funds, and they aren't exposed to the [weird dynamics](https://www.wsj.com/articles/municipal-bonds-suddenly-look-cheap-some-are-tax-traps-11662735718) that follow from the tax-exempt status of muni bonds. Buying bonds that are federally tax-exempt in a federally tax-advantaged account is also suboptimal: the bonds have a lower yield than they otherwise would _because_ they're federally tax-exempt. The other type of investment is any security that doesn't have distributions. Unfortunately there are no US-listed stock funds that lack dividends, but there are stocks that pay no dividends like [BRK-B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-B). I mention this only as an intellectual possibility, because I don't recommend investing in individual stocks. [↩](#fn3)
